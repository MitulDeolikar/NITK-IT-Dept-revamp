            <h3>B.Tech (in Information Technology)</h3><br>
            <p>The B.Tech programme in Information Technology was the first program to be offered by the Department when
                it was established in the year 2000. It has since grown from strength to strength and is currently one
                of the top and most sought after disciplines at NITK Surathkal. The course currently has an average
                intake of 110 students per year. The programme is innovatively designed to cater to global and industry
                demands and offers a balanced coverage of foundation concepts and application oriented courses. Our
                students have consistently achieved excellent placements of nearly 100% each year and several have been
                accepted/are pursuing post graduate and doctoral studies at reputed National and International
                Universities.</p><br><br>
